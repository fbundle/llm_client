"""Sparse V attention: skip WHT+dequant for positions with negligible weight.

After softmax, the tail of attention weights is heavy: at long context,
most positions contribute < 1e-5 to the weighted sum over V. Running a
full O(d log d) WHT butterfly for every cached V vector is wasted work
when the result will be scaled by a near-zero weight.

This module replaces the v0 kernel (which stubbed the butterfly and was
never wired) with a correct one:

  - One threadgroup per attention head, `dim` threads.
  - For each cached position, all threads coherently check the weight.
    Positions with weight below `threshold` are skipped — no packed load,
    no butterfly, no accumulate.
  - For active positions, the threadgroup cooperatively runs the raw WHT
    butterfly on the position's codebook values (same butterfly used in
    packed_dequantize) and accumulates weight * butterfly_elem *
    v_norms[pos].
  - At the end, signs and the 1/sqrt(d) scale are applied once per
    output element (pulled out of the inner loop since they are constant
    per-element across positions).

Correctness anchor: with `threshold = 0.0` the kernel must produce the
same result as the dense path (weights @ packed_dequantize(v)) up to
float32 noise. That is the test pinned in tests/test_sparse_v.py.
